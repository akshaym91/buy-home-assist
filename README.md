# Buy Home Assist

This is a simple application built with HTML, CSS and jQuery that uses the power of public API to give prospective home buyers an ability to survey the area in which they would like to setup their homes.

The application takes as input the street address and city names and gives:
1. an image of the locality on the background
2. list of articles related to the locality listed in New York Times
3. wikipedia links of popular items related to the locality

The course is part of the Udacity Nanodegree in Fullstack Web Development.
